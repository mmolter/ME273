    "This looks to be the last Guided Activity of the ME273 semester. While MATLAB was specifically designed for performing matrix operations, I think the modern [`numpy`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html) python libraries will give MATLAB a run for its (very large sum of) money. Numpy is a [wraper](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/user/c-info.python-as-glue.html) for down-to-the-metal `FORTRAN` and `C` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, Jupyter Notebook has a number of built-in [`magic`](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) methods to help with code timing. Today we will be working with `%timeit` and `%%timeit` (the multi-line cousin). These decorators will run the line of code 3 to 1000 times (depending on computational intensity) and report the mean, worst, and best-case runtimes.\n",

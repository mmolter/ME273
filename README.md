# ME273 - Computational Methods in Mechanical Engineering

Computational Methods in Mechanical Engineering is a course at Bradley University designed to teach students the fundametals of applying numerical techniques to engineering problems. The course will focus on MATLAB, C, and Python. I, however, will focus on Python.

## Getting Started

The solutions are now being implemented in IPython. This is a requisite for running the notebooks.

## Running the tests

Currently, these projects are untested. Testing is not a requirement for ME273, but it is something I would like to implment. Before every "Guided Activity" is released, we implement the model in Microsoft Excel. It would be reasonably easy to use the Excel-based solutions to validate the code-based answers.

## Deployment

Typically, when a new "Guided Activity" is released, the assignment sheet is posted in a new folder, and then commited to master. In a perfect world, a new branch for the project would be created at the same time.

## Built With

* [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/) - The language of choice.
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) - Package for fast, C-based, numerical computation.
* [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) - Package for using FORTRAN scientific computing libraries.

## Authors
